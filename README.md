# Image Recognition


This repo has code from Jupyter Labs and I have used an Nvidia Jetson nano in combination with a USB camera to run image recognition so that when the system recognizes for example a red triangle, it will send a serial command to an Arudino which is also hooked up to the Jetson Nano.

I will include any code from Jupyter Labs into this repo. I will also include the Arduino code.
